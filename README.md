I'm a new entrant into this lovely world of software engineering, based in Auckland, New Zealand but open to wherever software takes me.

Currently living in webland at work with some Typescript, React and Golang but most familiar personally with Typescript, React, Python and a little bit of Java. Personally interested in learning some Rust / Compiler / OS stuff
