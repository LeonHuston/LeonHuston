I'm a new entrant into this lovely world of software engineering, based in Auckland, New Zealand but open to wherever software takes me.

Currently living in backend-land at work with Golang, used to do more frontend stuff with Typescript/React and most familiar personally with Typescript, React, Python and a little bit of Java. Been dabbling with some rust on the side
